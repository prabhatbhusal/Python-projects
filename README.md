    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>To begin your Python journey, you need to install Python on your system. Follow the steps below to install Python and set up your development environment:</p>

    <pre><code># On Windows
1. Download Python from the official website: <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python.org</a>
2. Run the installer and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
3. Verify installation by typing `python --version` in the command prompt.

# On macOS or Linux
1. Use the following command:
   sudo apt install python3 (for Linux)
   brew install python (for macOS)
2. Verify installation by typing `python3 --version` in the terminal.</code></pre>
